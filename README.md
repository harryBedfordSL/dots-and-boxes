# Deployment

The game is hosted via github pages: https://harrybedfordsl.github.io/dots-and-boxes/

# How to play

The goal is to strategically create boxes and prevent your opponent from doing the same. If you complete a box, you get another turn, so try to set up multiple boxes in a single move.

1. **Setup:** Start by configuring your game. 2 - 4 players can play; you can enable a timer if you want to add a time limit to each turn.

2. **Turns:** Take turns connecting two adjacent dots with a line. The line can be horizontal or vertical, but not diagonal.

3. **Completing a Box:** When a player completes the fourth side of a box by drawing a line, they get a point and get to take another turn.

4. **Game End:** The game continues until all the dots are connected and no more moves can be made. The player with the most boxes wins the game.
